          the exposure; with a healthy, competitive, and productive environment

          technological eminence. NIMBUS has carved a niche for itself as one of
          the biggest technical fests in India.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the years, NIMBUS has created its reputation for being the most
          magnificent and prestigious technical fest. NIMBUS is the technical
          convention wherein all departmental and core clubs, along with the
          societies of NIT Hamirpur, participate to create projects which can
          bridge the gap to the unachievable future. This NIMBUS'22 we shall
          expand our horizons and blur the lines between reality and illusion.
          This year, we will take a plunge into the virtual realm and rise above
          reality.
          <br />
          <br />
          This year NIMBUS is set to delve into the world of innovation and
          creativity with its themeâ€œUdantya: An Occultic Cyberverse". The term
          "Udantya" is a Sanskrit word that means living beyond boundaries and
          limits. When reality becomes monotonous, unbearable, and achievable
          like these times, then a fascination with the magical world rises in
          us. The enchantment, to live in this magical realm is what one dreams
          of. The fire to achieve the impossible and accomplish the
          unaccomplished is what drives humanity.
